ABOUT RECONCILIATION DATASETS:

These datasets were culled from access points in the NET collection dataset and reconciled with Library of Congress linked data services to obtain URIs matching name headings; the credits and names datasets were also reconciled with Wikidata. Additionally, the credits and names datasets contain a column (spreadsheets) or element (XML file) to identify names that have no URIs so that they can be later added to the name authority file. All of these datasets contain URIs that were matched to names in the NET collection PBCORE standardized dataset and inserted into @ref attributes and later imported into $0 subfields in MARC-XML.
